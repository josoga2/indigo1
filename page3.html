As an instructor, you are contracting directly with EkoPAD, regardless of whether another EkoPad subsidiary pays you or not.

Instructors will be permitted to host Course(s) and if not objected to within 30 days, such Course(s) will be approved and the instructors paid 50% of the enrollment fee.

When instructors publish a course on EkoPAD, they grant EkoPAD a license to offer a license to the course to students. This means that we have the right to sublicense the course to the students who enroll in the course.

EkoPAD complies with copyright laws. 
</div><div>•	EkoPAD has discretion in enforcing these Terms. We may terminate or suspend your permission to use our platform and Services or ban your account at any time, with or without notice, for any violation of these Terms, if you fail to pay any fees when due, upon the request of law enforcement or government agencies, for extended periods of inactivity, for unexpected technical issues or problems, or if we suspect that you engage in fraudulent or illegal activities. Upon any such termination we may delete your account and content, and we may prevent you from further access to the platforms and use of our Services. Your content may still be available on the platforms even if your account is terminated or suspended. You agree that we will have no liability to you or any third party for termination of your account, removal of your content, or blocking of your access to our platforms and services.

Under our Instructor Agreement, we require our instructors to follow the law and respect the intellectual property rights of others. For more details on how to file a copyright or trademark infringement claim with us, visit contact@ekopad.org 
</div><div>When the instructor post comments, questions, reviews, and when the instructor submit to us ideas and suggestions for new features or improvements, the instructor authorize EkoPAD to use and share this content with anyone, distribute it and promote it on any platform and in any media, and to make modifications or edits to it as we see fit. In legal language, by submitting or posting content on or through the platforms, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and distribute your content in any and all media or distribution methods (existing now or later developed). This includes making your content available to other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with EkoPAD for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication of content on other media. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power, and authority necessary to authorize us to use any content that you submit. The Instructor also agrees to all such uses of the content with no compensation paid to the Instructor. In these terms an Instructor is also regarded as a user of EkoPAD.
</div><div><strong>User Agreement
</strong></div><div>You are required to register with EkoPAD as a User. A user of EkoPAD is a learner. The User can enroll a Course for a specified fee, post educative materials, or engage in any educative activity on EkoPAD. The User is expected to protect account information made available to EkoPAD as the Institution will not be responsible for any laxity on the part of the User. We do not review or edit the courses for legal issues, and we are not in a position to determine the legality of course content. We do not exercise any editorial control over the courses that are available on the platform and, as such, do not guarantee in any manner the reliability, validity, accuracy or truthfulness of the courses. If you enroll a course, you rely on any information provided by an instructor at your own risk. 
</div><div>By using the Services, you may be exposed to content that you consider offensive, indecent, or objectionable. EkoPAD has no responsibility to keep such content from you and no liability for your access or enrollment in any course, to the extent permissible under applicable law. This also applies to any courses relating to health, wellness and physical exercise. You acknowledge the inherent risks and dangers in the strenuous nature of these types of courses, and by enrolling in such courses; you choose to assume those risks voluntarily, including risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death. You assume full responsibility for the choices you make before, during and after your enrollment in a course. 
</div><div>When you interact directly with a student or an instructor, you must be careful about the types of personal information that you share. We do not control what students and instructors do with the information they obtain from other users on the platform. You should not share your email or other personal information about you for your safety. 
</div><div>We do not hire or employ instructors nor are we responsible or liable for any interactions involved between instructors and students. We are not liable for disputes, claims, losses, injuries, or damage of any kind that might arise out of or relate to the conduct of instructors or students. Instructors are allowed to have assistant instructors or tutors but there shall be no privity of contract whatsoever between the latter and EkoPAD. 
</div><div>When you use our Services, you will find links to other websites that we don’t own or control. We are not responsible for the content or any other aspect of these third-party sites, including their collection of information about you. You should also read their terms and conditions and privacy policies. 
</div><div>As a student, when you enroll in a course, whether it’s a free or paid course, you are getting from EkoPAD a license to view the course via the EkoPAD platform and Services, and EkoPAD is the licensor of record. Courses are licensed, and not sold, to you. This license does not give you any right to resell the course in any manner (including by sharing account information with a purchaser or illegally downloading the course and sharing it on torrent sites).
</div><div>EkoPAD grants you (as a student) a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and view the courses and associated content for which you have paid all required fees, solely for your personal, non-commercial, educational purposes through the Services, in accordance with these Terms and any conditions or restrictions associated with a particular course or feature of our Services. All other uses are expressly prohibited. You may not reproduce, redistribute, transmit, assign, sell, broadcast, rent, share, lend, modify, adapt, edit, create derivative works of, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or use any course unless we give you explicit permission to do so in a written agreement signed by a EkoPAD authorized representative. This also applies to content you can access via any of our APIs. Tutors may not grant licenses to their courses to student directly and any such direct license shall be null and void and a violation of these Terms. 
</div><div>The Tutor and User relationship must be maintained in consonance with applicable rules and regulations and subject rules of natural justice, equity and good conscience. There shall be no assignment of any rights; all disputable cases shall be subject to arbitration after 1 month notice has been given by the asserting party to submit such matter to arbitration. Before any update or change is made on EkoPAD, a 14 days’ notice will be given.
</div><div>We may add or remove functions, features, or requirements, and we may suspend or stop part of our Services altogether. We may not be able to deliver the Services to certain regions or countries for various reasons, including due to applicable export control requirements or internet access limitations and restrictions from governments. None of EkoPAD, its Content Providers and instructors, its contributors, sponsors, and other business partners, and their employees, contractors, and other agents (the "EkoPAD Parties") shall have any liability to you for any such action. You can stop using our Services at any time.
</div><div>If it turns out that a particular provision of these Terms is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. If you do not comply with these Terms, and we do not take immediate action, this does not indicate that we relinquish any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future). Any feedback, comments, or suggestions you may provide regarding EkoPAD or the Services is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments, or suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation to you.
